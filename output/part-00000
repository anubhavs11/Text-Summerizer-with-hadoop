By 2050, between 350 million and 600 million people are projected to experience increased water stress due to climate change (see Climate change in Africa).	
Due to confusing media coverage in the early 1990s, issues such as ozone depletion and climate change were often mixed up, affecting public understanding of these issues.	
In 1986 and November 1987, NASA climate scientist James Hansen gave testimony to Congress on global warming.	
Mitigation of climate change are actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.	
There were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988, and when Hansen testified in the Senate on 23 June he sparked worldwide interest.
